An e-commerce company wants to analyze its customer purchases, product performance, and revenue trends to make better business decisions. The dataset includes customers, products, and orders.
The goal of this project is to use PostgreSQL to answer key business questions such as:

Who are the top customers by spending?
What are the monthly sales trends?
Which products are most popular?
How much revenue comes from different payment methods?
What is the ratio of new vs repeat customers?

The database consists of three tables:
customers → customer details (ID, name, city, join date)
products → product details (ID, name, category, price)
orders → order details (ID, customer, product, order date, quantity, payment method)

Tools Used:
PostgreSQL (Database)
pgAdmin (Query execution & CSV export)
Excel / Power BI (Optional: for visualizing query results)
